<span class="animated-text">This text elegantly fades in and scales up.</span>

* * *
In this code:

I've defined a CSS animation called fadeInScale that smoothly fades in and scales up the text from a smaller size to its full size.

The <span> element with the class animated-text is targeted for this animation.

This example will make the "This text elegantly fades in and scales up" text fade in while gently scaling up, creating a more beautiful and elegant animation effect. You can further adjust the animation duration, timing function, and other properties to achieve your desired aesthetic.

To create an animation with blue and red color for your text, you can use CSS animations with keyframes to transition between colors. Here's an example of a simple color-changing animation:

<span class="animated-text">This text changes color from blue to red.</span>

* * *
In this code:

I've created a CSS animation named colorChange that transitions the color of the text from blue to red and back to blue.

The <span> element with the class animated-text is targeted for this animation.

This example will make the text inside the <span> element change color from blue to red and back to blue in a continuous loop. You can adjust the animation duration and colors as needed to achieve the desired effect.

## <span class="animated-text">**Project:**</span>

### **Design and Development of magnetic bicycle:**
The conversion of magnetic power into mechanical energy is the prime subject of study for the researcher. The project on magnetic powered hybrid bicycle is focused on the investigation of the feasibility of the mechanical energy from the magnet which use its natural properties of attraction and repulsion of the magnet poles to create rotation of the shaft which can be harnessed to do a useful work.

### **Design:**
The strong Neodymium magnets (NdFeB40MGOe) arranged in proper inclination in flywheel and cover design and assembled in bicycle sprocket shaft produce magnetic force to assist the human effort. This investigation project was proposed by performing paper research, experiments, hardware prototype development and software simulation.

### **Procedure:**
The flywheel design was performed in Solidworks, magnetic simulation was performed in ANSYS software (FEMM). The repulsive force between magnets in outer circumference of flywheel and inner surface of the cover provides torque in sprocket shaft in addition to manual torque. The magnetic field, resultant force on magnetic flywheel was determined for rectangular magnets in circular position by magnetic simulation. The performance characteristic of the bicycle was determined by conducting practical experiment. The final design of the prototype was selected based on the optimum result obtained from the magnetic simulation in FEMM software. The alternative magnetic shielding material was used instead of Mu metal due to unavailability in local market. 

### **Conclusion:**
The performance of the bicycle was found to be increased significantly after implementation of the magnetic flywheel. Thus, the detail study on this project has led to the need of more research and can be developed as one of means of green energy.
