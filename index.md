### **Bike Sharing Project:**
Building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. The project is based on a dataset provided by BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, which aims to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes in the American market.
* * *
### **House Price Prediction:** 
Predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques such as Ridge and Lasso.
* * *
### **Telecom Churn Prediction:**
Building the best prediction machine learning model using the provided data that is able to predict churning customers. And identify the important predictor variables for churn by building different models like logistic regression, decision trees or random Forest and choose the best performing model based on evaluation Metrics and business objectives.
* * *
### **Melanoma-Detection Project:**
Building a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow, that can assist dermatologists to detect melanoma accurately and efficiently.
* * *
### **Gesture Reorganization Project:**
Building a gesture recognition feature in the smart-TV using deep learning techniques that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.
* * *
### **Design and Development of Magnetic Bicycle:**
The conversion of magnetic power into mechanical energy is the prime subject of study for the researcher. The project on magnetic powered hybrid bicycle is focused on the investigation of the feasibility of the mechanical energy from the magnet which use its natural properties of attraction and repulsion of the magnet poles to create rotation of the shaft which can be harnessed to do a useful work.

* * *

### **Design:**
The strong Neodymium magnets (NdFeB40MGOe) arranged in proper inclination in flywheel and cover design and assembled in bicycle sprocket shaft produce magnetic force to assist the human effort. This investigation project was proposed by performing paper research, experiments, hardware prototype development and software simulation.

* * *

### **Procedure:**
The flywheel design was performed in Solidworks, magnetic simulation was performed in ANSYS software (FEMM). The repulsive force between magnets in outer circumference of flywheel and inner surface of the cover provides torque in sprocket shaft in addition to manual torque. The magnetic field, resultant force on magnetic flywheel was determined for rectangular magnets in circular position by magnetic simulation. The performance characteristic of the bicycle was determined by conducting practical experiment. The final design of the prototype was selected based on the optimum result obtained from the magnetic simulation in FEMM software. The alternative magnetic shielding material was used instead of Mu metal due to unavailability in local market.

* * *

### **Conclusion:**
The performance of the bicycle was found to be increased significantly after implementation of the magnetic flywheel. Thus, the detail study on this project has led to the need of more research and can be developed as one of means of green energy.
